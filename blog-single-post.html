					Country is the best. You may visit the country in the month of february and march since its considerably cooler and less polluted than the other time of the year. You may bring chocolates for the kids to feed them since they are all poor and hungry and always looking to fool you. The cows are very friendly howver they can be mean sometimes too. You'll get some gobar free if lucky.
